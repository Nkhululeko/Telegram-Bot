# FamilyBot

FamilyBot is a Telegram bot built with the `python-telegram-bot` library. It helps users gather and manage information about their family members through a conversation-based interface.

## Features

- **Add Family Members**: Users can add information about their family members, including parents and children.
- **Add Personal Information**: Users can add their own details, such as name and age.
- **Display Collected Data**: Users can view the information they have entered about themselves and their family members.
- **Nested Conversations**: The bot handles complex conversations, guiding the user through different stages of data entry.

## Prerequisites

Before running the bot, make sure you have the following:

1. **Python 3.7+**: The bot is developed in Python, so you'll need to have Python installed on your system.
2. **Telegram Bot Token**: You need a bot token from the Telegram BotFather. If you don't have one, you can create a bot and obtain the token by following [these instructions](https://core.telegram.org/bots#6-botfather).

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Nkhululeko/Telegram-Bot.git
